# Sidechains ZK

Zero knowledge cryptography code and JNI bindings for sidechains, implementing
SNARK-based [Ad-hoc Threshold MultiSignatures (ATMS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8835275).

## Overview

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a Halo2 circuit that provides a proof that there
exists `t` valid signatures of some subset of a given set of public keys. This is the first effort of implementing a
SNARK-based Ad-hoc Threshold Multi Signature scheme.

The implementation leverages SNARK-friendly cryptographic primitives:

- **Zero Knowledge Proving System**: Halo2 with KZG commitments
- **Parent Curve**: BLS12-381 (compatible with Cardano Plutus)
- **Embedded Curve**: JubJub curve (defined over BLS12-381 scalar field)
- **Digital Signature**: Schnorr signatures over JubJub curve
- **Hash Function**: Rescue hash for SNARK-friendly operations

## Cryptographic Background

### Ad-hoc Threshold Multi-Signatures (ATMS)

ATMS is a multisignature scheme that allows key-pair owners to create a threshold signature without complex distributed
key generation (ad-hoc) or interactive signature procedures. The original
paper "[Proof-of-Stake Sidechains](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8835275)" by Gazi, Kiayias,
and Zindros proposes three construction methods:

1. **Trivial ATMS**: Simple aggregation with individual verification
2. **Pairing-based ATMS**: Efficient but requires full participation
3. **SNARK-based ATMS**: Most efficient signatures, verifier independent of participation

This implementation focuses on **SNARK-based ATMS** for optimal efficiency and scalability.
